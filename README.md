## Objective
This application helps estimating UK used cars price based on:  make, model, year, transmission, mileage, fuel type, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size.
The application can be accessed at: https://usedcarspredict.herokuapp.com/

## Data Source
The data was downloded from Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes?select=vw.csv. It contains 100,000 scraped used car listings, cleaned and split into car make. The last update was done in June, 2020.

## Architecture
* For Storage: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) was used because of its offering on scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 
* For Application Deployment: Heroku was used as cloud platform to deploy the application because its suppport of different programming languages.
